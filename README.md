A multiplayer racing game in HTML5 (a tribute to the awesome Micro Machines 2 on Megadrive) playable up to 8 players.
<br/>
Players can play with keyboard, USB gamepads (using HTML5 Gamepad API), and my own concept called Phonepad: a phone connected to the Internet used as a gamepad (thanks to webRTC on Android and websockets on iPhone).
